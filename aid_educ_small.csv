(2) Some 600 units will be built to provide teachers, especially those who are single, with rent-free housing. (3) To ensure school building maintenance, a maintenance manual will be developed for teachers, who will also receive motivational training and modest funds for simple, preventive maintenance work with student help. Also, 18 departmental maintenance agents and 18 assistants will be hired, and a department-level maintenance system will be established under the Directorate General of School Construction. (4) The system of educational supervision and in-service training (ITT) will be improved. Twelve new teachers will be hired for MOE's Pedagogical/ITT Group Section, whose training curricula will be upgraded, and a long-range training plan will be developed for all educational personnel. The new teachers, along with national and developmental supervisors, will participate in a month-long orientational/motivational course (five such courses are planned) on the project's relation to the national Educational Plan and specific educational issues. Eight ITT Groups, two Pedagogical Sections, and one national supervisor will receive specialized 4-month training abroad and, along with the 12 new trainers, university-level training in general and specialized educational courses. Other training includes 14 2-week courses for supervisors in such areas as course content and community relations and a 15-day course in the production/use of modular teaching materials.

The project will (1) institutionalize math curricula for grades 2-5; (2) develop a health curriculum for grades 3-5; (3) conduct related monitoring and evaluation; and (4) extend IRI to out-of- school children and adults. The IRI math curriculum developed under project 5110597 for grades 2-3 will be institutionalized in at least 7 of the country's 9 departments. A key activity in this process will be the development of a multiplier-type training of trainers program in which PVO subcontractor instructors will train MEC supervisors and teachers in IRI methodology; the latter will in turn train school directors, who will in their turn be responsible for training additional teachers. Additional outputs include teachers' guides; agreements with radio stations for transmitting the lessons; a system for distributing and maintaining radios; and training of supervisors in evaluation of the IRI lessons. While the math curriculum is being implemented nationwide, EDC and participating NGO's will develop health curriculum modules and teachers' guides for grades 3-5.

To extend the effects of IRI health education into the communities, PVO and MOH health promoters will be invited to listen to the IRI broadcasts and will be given teachers' guides, which they can adapt for use with their adult clients. The project will conduct baseline studies for the development of the health modules, operations research to measure behavioral outcomes, and formative and summative evaluations based on both formal testing and classroom observations.

The capability of the Polytechnic will be increased so that it can train and graduate 400 certificate, 75 diploma, and 25 degree holders annually by 1984, and so that it can provide consulting services to the engineering community. To this end, a contracted institution will provide four U.S. technicians for a total of 13 person-years to assist the Polytechnic in developing its engineering programs, and 55 person-years of degree training in the United States for 16 Malawians who will serve as instructors at the Polytechnic. Twelve of these are currently tutors and teaching assistants in four engineering disciplines at the Polytechnic. The others include two women on the polytechnic staff who will receive M.S.-level training; a senior staff member who will study for a Ph.D. in hydrology; and a counterpart for the project's career counsellor. USAID will provide funds for the construction of an 18,000 sq. ft. science building, a 26,000 sq. ft. library, and four 3-bedroom houses for senior staff, and will furnish science and library equipment and books. The British Overseas Development Agency and the European Development Fund are currently funding some teaching positions at the Polytechnic and have proposed grants to fund the construction and renovation of additional buildings. The African Development Fund also plans to contribute funds for equipment and building construction and renovation.

Part of the industrial engineering curriculum will be geared to industrial garment-making and computers. It is estimated that women will represent more than 30 percent of the enrollment in this new area of study at ITCA. In addition, informal six-week training courses will be added to ITCA's program to help skilled workers expand their abilities. äó¢Equipment and Teaching Materials.The project will recondition or replace basic shop and laboratory equipment and provide furnishings and equipment to support the new areas of study. The library's services also will be expanded, including the purchase of 10,000 reference books, textbooks, and technical journals. äó¢Physical Plant. ITCA's buildings, damaged by the 1986 earthquake, will be repaired and remodeled.
